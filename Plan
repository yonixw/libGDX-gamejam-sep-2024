* The 4 Elements (Fire, Water, Earth, Air)
* The truth can only be learned by marching forward
    The Problem
            Packer wants the very rare dragon shard
                VS
            Group wants money
    The Truth: 
            Hard decision a head, with hard choises, money OR friendship
                1) Sometimes being nice won't help you (if you pass on loot)
                     Gave high tips, didn't get plant
                        BUT team has hard problems
                2) Sometimes you will be around shit pupils even if talented
                    Gave high tips, didn't get plant
                        Team were rich anyway
                3) Nice pupil do exist
                        Packer gets shard from dragon only
                        3.5) Other cases: "Sometimes your goals align"
                4) Money will require other sacrifices 
                    (like other personal belongings)
                    You need to keep at least one of each team member so they won't quit
                    
                    
Mechanics:
    * Teams of 3 + Packer
    * You tell them what monster
    * Random type and lever
    * They answer what needed, for it to be easy(90%),med(20%),hard(5%)
    
    * If you lose, then lost ingridients
        * 3 turns with missed attacke ( def >> attack) = Flee for non agro monsters
    * Win: 
        Money (%level)
        Blobs (100 shard-> To beat dragon)
        Junk that will be affected by blob with Money value
        Weapon (Monter Def +-
    
    * Blobs affect adjacent cells
        * Fire burns papers (maps)
        * Water diminish Fire
        * Air + Fire bursts to air direction
        * Earth + Water ruins both
        
        Safe: {Water, Air}, {Air, Earth} {Earth, Fire}
        
        Fire Water Earth Air
Fire    1	0	1	0
Water   1	1	0	1
Earth   1	0	1	1
Air     0	1	1	1

        
    * Blob affect weapon (stays until weapon break?)
        
    * Chat of events?
        * Fight Monster Y
        * Need X for Monster Y
        * Monster Y Defeated/Escaped
